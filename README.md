### Hello everyone out there 👋

I am Henrik, a Software Development Nerd. 

❤️ I am passionate about tech in general, but specifically distributed solutions/services.

🚀 I am using 🐧 at home [#ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), 🍏 when on the go and 🪟 at work.

⚙️ I like [golang](https://golang.org/), [dotnet](http://dot.net/) even [python](https://www.python.org/), but [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is beyond me. I cannot grasp the complexity, and have no time to start the journey.

😀 Let me tinker with [containers](https://opencontainers.org/), [pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines) and I am happy.

🏁 I will almost always go for CLIs instead of GUIs.
