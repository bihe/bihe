### Hello everyone out there 👋

I am Henrik, a Software Development Nerd. 

❤️ I am passionate about tech in general, but specifically distributed solutions/services

⚙️ I both like [dotnet](http://dot.net/) and [golang](https://golang.org/)

🏁 I will almost always go for CLIs instead of GUIs -> OS agnostic Linux/Mac/Win
